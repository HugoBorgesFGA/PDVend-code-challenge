This is a regular Android Studio project.
Just open it, make sure gradle is synced and it should be fine.

The following libs were used:

	-> Retrofit: access Flickr API endpoints
	-> GSON: serializes/deserializes Flickr API JSON response.
	-> Glide: loads Flickr pictures

Any doubt: hugobp14@hotmail.com
